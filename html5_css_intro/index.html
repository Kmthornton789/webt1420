        <h2>The Destiny Universe story</h2>
        <img src="Images/The_Last_City.jpg" alt="Man standing on tower looking over the city">
        <p>The story of Destiny 2 is very long and deep. You're a hero known as a Guardian. You protect what remains of humanity. Humanity had a golden age of technology, agriculture growth, and space exploration. 
            Humanity had made it all the way to Venus and beyond. During the peak years of the Golden Age, they discovered an orb known as: The Traveler. The Traveler is a gardener of sorts. It terraforms planets and brings growth to them.
            Years after they had reached their peak, something known as the Darkness appeared and destroyed the colonies. This era is known as, The Collapse and is rather depressing. Trillions of lives lost, and the greatest minds of humanity are now gone. 
Y           The player starts out in a rusty junkyard full of cars and broken bridges. You get woken up by a small companion and they tell you that you're a guardian. Throughout the story of Destiny 1 you learn more about the Traveler and the Darkness. 
            At the end of the story you become known as, The Guardian. This is because you have become one of the strongest guardians known to Humanity. 
        There are atleast four dlcs for Destiny 1. After all those stories, Destiny 2's story takes place.
