   <h1>Vincent Van Gogh</h1>
        <p>Vincent was born in the Netherlands on March 30, 1853. He was a Dutch Painter, who sadly only sold one artwork during his life. 
            He acheived a 10-year artisitic career and he had this vivid personal style to his art. He struggled with mental illness-believed to be early depression-as well as living in poverty. 
         He was not only an artist, but actually had several other jobs. He was an art dealer, language teacher, lay preacher, bookseller and missionary worker. </p>

    <h2>Notable Artworks</h2>
        <p>Some of Vincent's artworks were never appreciated until after his death. For example, The Starry Night. It truly is a shame, because the depth of this artwork amazes people to this day. 
            This artwork is a mix of rich blues, supposed to be the night sky along with some dark greens for trees, plants and grassland. In the bottom right, you can see a small village or town. 
            What makes this painting so unique is just the way he painted it along with colors and mixtures he used.

    <h3>More Details</h3>
    <p>Vincent had a mix of style or movement. The mixture usually comprised of: Expressionism, Post-Impressionism, and Symbolism. 
        Expressionism is the artisitic style in which the artist seeks to depict not the reality in an objective manner but the subjective emotions. 
        Post-Imopressionism is basiacally an art style that sought/seeks to capture a feeling or experience rather than acheive an accurate depiction. 
        Symbolism is the art style where the artists sought to express individual emtoional experiences. They did it through subtle and suggestive use of highly symbolized languages. 
        This is what makes Vincent's work much more beautiful. He had this talented way of doing this mixture so well, but in the wrong era. If he had been born in this era, I belive people would love him so much more.
