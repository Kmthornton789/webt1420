        <h1>What is Photography?</h1>
        <p> What is Photography? According to experts online, "The word Photography literally means 'drawing with light', which derives from the Greek photo, meaning light and graph, meaning to draw. 
            Photography is the process of recording an image. This could be a photograph on a lightsensitive film.
            Or it could be a photograph in the case of digital photography, via a digital electronic or magnetic memory." 
            This sounds really fascinating. Let us dig into it more!

        <h2>The Earliest Kind of Photography.</h2>
        <p> In the past, before photography was a thing, there was mainly just art. Art consisted of painting, sketching/drawing and so on. 
            This is because the first camera wouldn't come around until 1816. Today though, art is considered: sketching, painting, photography, graphic designing. 
            Anything that you put time into, can be considered art. Wanna take a picture of a sunset? Boom that is art my friend! 
            If you took the time to capture the sunset in a perfect angle, or at a perfect time, it is considered art!
            This being said, think about Vincent Van Gogh. The main was very unappreciated during his time for his art. He painted the most interesting works of art, but no one liked them at the time; because they were different.

            <h3>Earliest Photography</h3>
            <p>Earliest_Photography is essentially anything that comes before 1816 or the years around the first official camera being produced. 
                This is because art-before the camera- was handmade or painted/sketched or drawn with bare hands and materials. Time being put into something by hands and some materials made art what art was at the time. 
                These days, you can just grab an invention-already made up of materials you need- and click a button! Boom! it catches your art for you.

            <h4>Scenic and Landscape Photography</h4>
            <p> According to experts online, "The grand scenic photograph is one of the most common types of nature images. 
                It's usually the first kind of outdoor photos people begin making." This being said, it is sometimes confused with landscape. They CAN be the same, but most times; they are different subjects. 
                Landscape is closer to panoramas than they are to scenic. There are such things as Scenic Landscapes but really most times they are two different subjects.

            <h5>Game and AI Photography</h5>
            <p> Game Photography is any screenshot or picture or render of a game. This means any screenshot of a scene-cutscene, landscape, or character etc- can be an art piece. 
                What if you took a screenshot of a funny moment in a game or a beautiful scene in a game? YES! That is considered a piece of game art. With all of this in mind, a game itself is a piece of art. 
                We'll explain this later. We will also look more into AI photography as well as the debate around it.</p>
