   <h1>Game Photography</h1>
        <p>As said before, Game Photography is any screenshot or picture or render of a game. 
        This means any screenshot of a scene-cutscene, landscape, or character etc- can be an art piece. This makes it more fun, because it can be so many things!
        For example, look at the image below. Not only did the game developers and game artists/designer make that art, but someone saw it and felt good or enjoyed it.
        That's part of art. Art is something of a time-capsule and a message-at times. You can spend hours, maybe even weeks putting your heart into it. Not everyone will see what you want them to see, but they will definitely get their own message from it. 
        They will have their own perspective or see your perspective on it. </p>

        <p>Not everything in a game is going to beautful right away unless you know a little backstory. Not every piece of art will display the horror or fright meant to, unless the viewer knows the backstory. 
            For example, the second picture provided is horrifying. The thing the player is supposed to protect-don't worry the story is rigged-but fails is caught below when it has been defeated. 
            Four people-your helpers or trainers- are seen watching in horror unable to do anything to stop the madness or suffering soon to follow. This is part of art. Conveying your perspective or message, or what you want the viewer to see. 
            Hoping they see or feel what you want them to feel.</p>

    <h2>AI Photography</h2>
        <p>AI photography is something really new. It didn't fully start until maybe around 2021-2022. AI Art or photography is putting keywords into this search engine or machine UI, and then letting it generate art for you. 
            There is a massive debate around this, because it is not handmade or made like previous arts. You're literally being lazy, putting in words and having a robot make it for you. 
            There is nom time-capsule of one's heart and soul captured. It is simply just a robot doing effortless work that cannot capture the soul and heart of a human can with their hands. 
            That being said, there are some good works out there, because the 'keywords' came from a creative mind; but still aren't as good as someone did with their own hands. </p>
