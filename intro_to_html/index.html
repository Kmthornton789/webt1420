    <h2>Welcome to my Website</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Keegan. I am twenty-one years old and I will be twenty-two in december. I had a really rough childhood, so I generally can be sensitive or soft at times. 
        As a result of my past, I have come to want to enjoy life for all that it has to offer. Some of my hobbies that help me acheive this are: photography, hiking, swimming and so on. 
        I occassionally game with the guys whenever we're all free on weekends, and I have never laughed in my life; as hard as I do with them. 
        I suffer from a bipolar disorder, as well as an ADHD disorder, so me being able to have amazing friends like them, and enjoy these hobbies is very rare for me. 
        I love history, and this sometimes effects my view of games-if it doesn't have good backstory or lore-it's harder to enjoy it. 
        I am just a simple person, wanting to enjoy life while they can.</p>
        <p> If you are wondering why I chose the photo I did, then you're on the right track. I chose that photo, because it speaks to me. It soothes my soul, or calms me down.
            It's relaxing, it's a place where one can go to relax and meditate on their life and remember their blessings. That's another reason why I love photography. 
            You're capturing nature's beauty, along with a place that someone spent maybe a few minutes to an hour relaxing. You're essentially capturing a moment of someone's life. 
            That's the beauty of life sometimes. We go through everything so fast, and never take breaks, breaths or moments to be grateful for our blessings.</p>
