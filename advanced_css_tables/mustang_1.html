        <h2>The Muscle Cars that I love specifically. </h2>
        <p>The 1965 Ford Mustang was one of the most beautiful mustangs for the time that it came out. It was beautiful, and still is. 
            Not only did the appearance catch people's attention, but the 'purr' did as well. As stated earlier, the 1965 Mustang had three models. There was the hardtop, the fastback and the convertible. 
            There was a total of atleast sixteen colors you could get them in. Furthermore, there was atleast twelve options of colors for the interior trim. 
        
            The Hardtop had an engine named "200 CID Inline-6", with a HP of 120 @ 4,400 RPM. The torque on this baby, was around 190 lb-ft @ 2,400 RPM. There was a total of 372,123 of these made. 
        The Fastback had an engine named "289 CID 2-Barrel V8", with a HP of 200 @ 4,400 RPM. The torque was around 282 lb-ft @ 2,400 RPM. The total of these made, was around 71, 3030. 
        The Convertible had an engine named "289 CID 4-Barrel V8", with a HP of 225 @ 4,800 RPM. The torque on this beauty was around 305 lb-ft @ 3,200 RPM. There was only 65,663 of these made.
