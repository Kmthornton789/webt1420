        <h1>The Muscle Cars that I Love</h1>
        <img src="images/muscle_cars_lineup.jpg" alt="lineup of muscle cars">
        <p>There are a lot of cars that are considered 'muscle cars' throughout history, but not all of them are still around. 
        There are three that you have probably heard of: Mustang, Camaro, and Chargers. I am not a big fan of two of them, but I am a huge fan of Mustangs. 
        I would like to discuss or mention these, show you some images of them and talk about their specifications. There are so many models that I love. 
        I could have atleast seven pages, but I will control my childlike excitement.

        <h2>The Muscle Cars that I love specifically. </h2>
        <p>The Mustang is the one 'Muscle Car', that I absolutely love. I will never have enough wallpapers of them-especially when it's in black or blue.
        There are so many models of the mustang I love: 1965, 1969 & 1970, 2013, 2015, and the 2018. The body of these muscle cars is not the only beautiful thing. 
        The powerful sound or the 'purr' of them make them even more beautiful. With all this mentioned, let me get explain why this is what I believe.

            <p>The first Mustang to discuss is the 1965 Mustang. 
            The 1965 Mustang had three models. There was the hardtop, the fastback and the convertible. There was a total of atleast sixteen colors you could get them in. 
            Furthermore, there was atleast twelve options of colors for the interior trim. I don't know about you, but I like options. I like when I have a lot of good options too.
